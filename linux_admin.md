- Bash Shell variables
  - HOME
  - LOGNAME : login name
  - PWD
  - OLDPWD
  - PATH
    - This variable is essential in Linux. It helps the shell know where all the programs are located
    - When you enter a command into your Bash shell, it first has to search for that command through the Linux filesystem
    - To make any changes permanent, you must modify the PATH variable inside a file called `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`
  - SHELL
  - USER
  - TERM

```sh
printenv | grep PATH
echo $PATH
```

- Links
  - Symbolic Links
  - Hard Links
  - [Difference between soft vs hard](https://stackoverflow.com/a/185903)

```sh
# Soft Link
# ln -s [original_filename] [link_filename]
touch a.txt
ln -s a.txt b.txt
echo "aaa" >> a.txt
cat a.txt
cat b.txt
# return the name of the file the symbolic link points to
readlink b.txt

# Hard Link
# different virtual file that points to the original file
# they are physically the same
touch a.txt
ln a.txt b.txt
echo "aaa" >> a.txt
cat a.txt
cat b.txt
readlink b.txt

# more detailed info-name,size,type
stat a.txt
# report type of a file
file a.txt
```


- `less` print one page and allows navigation
- `head` print first 10 lines
- `tail` print last 10 lines
  - `-f` output appends as the file grows
