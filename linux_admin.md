- Bash Shell variables
  - HOME
  - LOGNAME : login name
  - PWD
  - OLDPWD
  - PATH
    - This variable is essential in Linux. It helps the shell know where all the programs are located
    - When you enter a command into your Bash shell, it first has to search for that command through the Linux filesystem
    - To make any changes permanent, you must modify the PATH variable inside a file called `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`
  - SHELL
  - USER
  - TERM

```sh
printenv | grep PATH
echo $PATH
```
