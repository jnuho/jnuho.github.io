- Network programming With Go

```
If you are joining a dev team that develops a remote management system using Golang MSA, gRPC, and AWS, here are some of the things that you should study:

Golang: You should have a good understanding of the Golang programming language, including its syntax, data types, control structures, and concurrency features. You should also be familiar with the standard library and third-party packages commonly used in Golang development.

Microservices Architecture (MSA): You should understand the principles of MSA and how it is implemented using Golang. This includes knowledge of service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, and other related topics.

gRPC: You should have a good understanding of gRPC, including its architecture, protocols, and how to define and implement gRPC services using Golang. You should also be familiar with the gRPC tooling, such as the protoc compiler and the various language-specific gRPC libraries.

AWS: You should have a good understanding of the AWS cloud platform, including its core services such as EC2, S3, and RDS. You should also be familiar with AWS security and access management, as well as the AWS command line interface (CLI) and the AWS software development kit (SDK) for Golang.

Distributed Systems: You should have a good understanding of distributed systems and the challenges that arise in developing and deploying them. This includes topics such as data consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability.

Testing: You should have a good understanding of testing methodologies and tools used in Golang development, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. You should also be familiar with tools such as go test and popular testing frameworks like ginkgo and goconvey.

Source Control Management (SCM): You should be familiar with source control management tools such as Git, including branching strategies, pull requests, and merging.

DevOps: You should be familiar with DevOps principles and tools, such as continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, containerization, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

Overall, joining a dev team that develops a remote management system using Golang MSA, gRPC, and AWS requires a broad range of skills and knowledge. You should be prepared to continuously learn and adapt as the project evolves and new challenges arise.

- Choosing a Network Topology
	- hybrid topology


- Bandwidth vs. Latency
	- Bandwidth : amount of data we can send over a network connection in an interval of time
	- Latency : a measure of the time that passes between
		- sending a network resource request and receiving a response
		- e.g. delay that occurs between clicking a link and the site's rendering the resulting page
		- high latency negatively affects user experience


- OSI network model
	- layer 7 Application
	- layer 6 Presentation
	- layer 5 Session
	- layer 4 Transport
	- layer 3 Network
	- layer 2 Data link (Logical link control, Media access control)
	- layer 1 Physical

- Sending Traffic using data Encapsulation
	- payload : data traveling down the stack
